INPUT FORMAT:

    1. File input.
Each structure reads from its own file (can change path).
First line: n - number of objects below. Then - n records about concerned
objects, separated by '\n'.
- [for Points]: "x1 y1" (two numbers representing coordinates of point)
- [for Segments]: "x1 y1 x2 y2" (four numbers representing coordinates of two
    points (ends of segment)).
- [for Lines]: "x1 y1 x2 y2" (four numbers representing coordinates of two
points (any two points on the line)).
- [for Triangles]: "x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3" (six numbers representing coordinates of
three points - vertices of triangle).

    2. Console input.
Follow instructions, data about structures should have particular format,
mentioned below (same as for files input):
- [for Points]: "x1 y1" (two numbers representing coordinates of point)
- [for Segments]: "x1 y1 x2 y2" (four numbers representing coordinates of two
points (ends of segment)).
- [for Lines]: "x1 y1 x2 y2" (four numbers representing coordinates of two
points (any two points on the line)).
- [for Triangles]: "x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3" (six numbers representing coordinates of
three points - vertices of triangle).
